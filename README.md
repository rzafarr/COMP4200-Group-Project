# 📱 Habit Tracker App

This is a simple and user-friendly Android application built to help users build better habits and stay organized.

The Habit Tracker App allows users to:

- Add, edit, and manage daily tasks with specific date and time deadlines.
- Get automatic reminders via notifications when a task is due.
- Mark tasks as ✅ Completed, 📦 Archived, or 🗑️ Deleted.
- Track daily progress through a visual progress bar.
- Filter tasks using intuitive chips: All Tasks (Menu), Completed, Archived, and Trash.

Built using Java and SQLite in Android Studio, this project combines key mobile development concepts like data storage, AlarmManager for notifications, and responsive UI using RecyclerView and Material Components.

## 📌 Note
Reminders are disabled for tasks once they’re moved to Completed, Archived, or Trash to avoid unnecessary notifications.

## ✅ Status
The app is fully functional with core features implemented and tested.
